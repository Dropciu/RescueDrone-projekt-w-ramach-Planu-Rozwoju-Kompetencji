            slogan: 'Autonomous Rescue Drone: Intelligent Support in Crisis Situations',
            abstract: 'Rescue Drone is a project of an autonomous rescue drone designed to deliver aid to hard-to-reach areas during crisis situations, such as floods. With advanced artificial intelligence and navigation systems, the drone analyzes threats, avoids obstacles, and chooses the best route. It can transport resources such as first aid kits, food, water, or AEDs to places cut off from assistance, supporting rapid rescue operations and enhancing safety in emergencies.',
            motivation: 'Motivation',
            motivationParagraph: 'In 2024, a flood in Poland demonstrated how difficult it is to deliver aid to villages and towns cut off from the world. In such situations, traditional rescue methods fail, and every second counts. Imagine an autonomous drone that not only delivers first aid kits, food, and water but also a portable defibrillator (AED) for people in need of immediate help. Such a drone, capable of reaching places inaccessible to rescue vehicles, can revolutionize rescue efforts in crisis situations, ensuring that help arrives on time regardless of the terrain conditions.',
            descriptionOfResearch: 'Description of Research',
            descriptionOfResearchParagraph: 'The Rescue Drone project combines advanced artificial intelligence with navigation systems and sensors that allow for precise access to designated locations even in the most extreme conditions. For example, in the case of a flood, the drone, using GPS, distance sensors, and an altimeter, will be able to analyze the terrain for flooded roads and obstacles. With artificial intelligence, it will predict where threats exist and choose the optimal route. In a real scenario, the drone can avoid dangerous flooded areas, avoid power lines, and deliver aid to places that would traditionally be impossible to reach. Moreover, by integrating with monitoring systems, the drone can continuously report the situation to rescue services, enabling quicker action and delivering help where it is most needed.',
            conclusions: 'Conclusions',
            conclusionsParagraph: 'The Rescue Drone is a breakthrough tool in crisis management. Its ability to operate autonomously in difficult conditions and adjust routes based on AI data allows it to quickly reach people in danger. For example, in the case of a flood, the drone can reach cut-off villages, delivering first aid kits, food, and essential medications. Research shows that drone technology, when properly designed and adapted to terrain conditions, significantly shortens response times and improves the effectiveness of rescue missions. By creating the Rescue Drone, we are building a tool that will become a key component in the future crisis response system, reducing the threat to human life and enabling faster and more effective rescue actions.'
